#### Branching
​
We are using *[A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)* so make sure you always sync your repo from the `PreMaster` branch and when you're done, pull request back into the `PreMaster` branch. This makes it easier to organize code, update changelogs, and add tags and version numbers.
​
When you want to start coding, create a new branch off of the `PreMaster` branch. You should name this banch `name-of-feature`.
​
Our main branch is `ReactNative`, if you want to submit your final copy, you can merge it to the `ReactNative` branch.
​
#### Pull Requests
​
Once you have completed you're code. Pull request your code into the `PreMaster` branch of this repo.
