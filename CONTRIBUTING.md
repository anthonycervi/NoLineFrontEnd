#### Branching
​
We are using *[A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)* so make sure you always sync your repo from the `dev` branch and when you're done, pull request back into the `dev` branch. This makes it easier to organize code, update changelogs, and add tags and version numbers.
​
When you want to start coding, create a new `feature` branch off of the `dev` branch. You should name this banch `feature/name-of-feature`.
​
​
#### Pull Requests
​
Once you have completed you're code. Pull request your code into the `dev` branch of this repo.
